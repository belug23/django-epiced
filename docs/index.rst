Welcome to Django-EpicEd's documentation
========================================

EpicEd is a markdown field with the default widjet using EpicEditor.js
http://epiceditor.com/

This plugin is made to keep a much as possible the possibilities to overide
EpicEditor.js configurations the only settings you'll not be able to edit
are 'container' and 'textarea' since they are rewriten by the wideget and
are needed to save the data to the database.
